- 👋 Hi, I’m @andrewstockt
- 👀 I’m interested in advancing my knowledge and learning as much as I can in this ever-changing industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack by taking courses and building a web/mobile app for a friend's business.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing right now, but in the future I hope to build up my public repo to include open-ended and open-source projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me here, however I don't get notifications so don't expect fast replies!
